about_me_description: <p> 
                          Passionate about research, I joined the AI scene in 2018 to solve 
                          business problems using machine learning and deep learning. There are 
                          days that I used to dread being a student but ironically now I call 
                          myself a 'Forever student'. True to my self proclamation, I love to 
                          consume the newest research ideas and apply them in my work. Among other 
                          things, you will find that I work to solve puzzles that inspire people to
                          consider their relationship with the data faction while contributing to 
                          the community and now have decided to connect with people via my 
                          <a class="highlight-link" href="https://blog.gopinathbalu.com" 
                          target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">writing.</a><p></p>Layered by years of 
                          experience in Computer Vision and NLP, my interest has now shifted to 
                          Knowledge Graphs and Graph Neural Networks. Chennai is my home but you can
                          find me on one too many weekend getaways. I love Cars and Stars 
                          and everything in between. If you really do want to hear about it, come
                          say hi!
                      </p>
